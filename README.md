# WeatherApp
Weather desktop app that displays live statistics using openweathermap.org's current weather data api, also saving the last 3 searches and creating shortcut buttons to those on startup(by connecting with a .db file).
<h4>I like this app and would name it one of my better ones even though it has less content than others because I use more interesting libraries:</h4>
<li>Requests
<li>Tkinter
<li>Json
<li>SQLLITE3<br>

(The "Problems 100" refers to the fact i didn't use all Tkinter functions available)
